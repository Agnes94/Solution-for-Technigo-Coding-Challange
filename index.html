  <div id="definition">
   <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</em></strong> is an extension of the <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>.
    It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.<br>The principal motivation for <strong>HTTPS</strong> is authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit.
    Historically, HTTPS connections were primarily used for payment transactions on the World Wide Web, e-mail and for sensitive transactions in corporate information systems.
    Since 2018, HTTPS is used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.</p>
